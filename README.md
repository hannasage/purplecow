# Project: Purple Cow

Before getting started, ensure your local device has Node.js, npm, and Angular 10+ installed. For more information visit `https://angular.io/guide/setup-local`.

## Waking up the purple cow

To begin the Angular live development server, first open your terminal and navigate to the project's root directory; in this case, that will be `/fearless-purplecow`. From here, you can run `ng` commands.

Once you're in this root directory, run `ng serve`. Your live development server should open on `http://localhost:3000`
